# üéì **SQL Lesson 1: SELECT Queries 101**

Learn the basics of retrieving data from a SQL database using **SELECT** statements, the foundation of querying in SQL. This lesson introduces the syntax and concepts through examples and exercises.

---

## üßê **What is a Query?**

A **query** is a statement that declares:

1. **What data** you are looking for.
2. **Where** to find it in the database.
3. **How** to optionally transform it before it is returned.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Understanding Tables in SQL**

- **Tables** in SQL represent entities (e.g., `Dogs`).
- **Rows** represent specific instances of those entities (e.g., _a pug, a beagle_).
- **Columns** represent properties shared by all instances (e.g., _color of fur, length of tail_).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Writing Your First SELECT Queries**

### **1. Query Specific Columns**

To select specific columns from a table:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM mytable;
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT title, director
FROM Movies;
```

The result is a subset of the table with only the requested columns.

---

### **2. Query All Columns**

To retrieve all columns:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mytable;
```

This is a quick way to inspect a table by returning all its data.
