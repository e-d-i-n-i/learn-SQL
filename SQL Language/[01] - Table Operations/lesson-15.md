## üìù **SQL Lesson 15: Deleting Rows**

In SQL, you can delete rows from a table using the `DELETE` statement. It's crucial to use the `WHERE` clause to specify which rows you want to remove. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, **all rows** will be deleted.

---

### **Delete Statement with Condition:**

```sql
DELETE FROM mytable
WHERE condition;
```

- **`WHERE` clause**: Determines which rows to delete based on a condition.
- If you leave out the `WHERE` clause, **all rows** are deleted, so **be extra cautious**.

---

### **Taking Extra Care**

Before running a `DELETE` statement, it's a good practice to test the condition using a `SELECT` query to ensure you‚Äôre deleting the correct rows. Always double-check your `DELETE` queries, especially in production environments, as this action is **irreversible** without a backup.

## üìö **Conclusion**

The `DELETE` statement allows you to remove data from a table, but always ensure you're deleting the right rows by verifying your conditions first. Running a `SELECT` query with the same `WHERE` clause can help you double-check which rows will be affected.
