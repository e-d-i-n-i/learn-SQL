## üìö **Text Operators for WHERE Clauses**

| **Operator** | **Condition**                        | **Example**                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `=`          | Case-sensitive exact match           | `col_name = "abc"`           |
| `!=` or `<>` | Case-sensitive inequality            | `col_name != "abcd"`         |
| `LIKE`       | Case-insensitive match               | `col_name LIKE "ABC"`        |
| `NOT LIKE`   | Case-insensitive inequality          | `col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD"`   |
| `%`          | Wildcard for zero or more characters | `col_name LIKE "%AT%"`       |
| `_`          | Wildcard for a single character      | `col_name LIKE "AN_"`        |
| `IN (‚Ä¶)`     | Value exists in a list               | `col_name IN ("A", "B")`     |
| `NOT IN (‚Ä¶)` | Value does not exist in a list       | `col_name NOT IN ("X", "Y")` |
