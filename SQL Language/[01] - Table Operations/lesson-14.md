## üìù **SQL Lesson 14: Updating Rows**

In SQL, you can update existing data in a table using the `UPDATE` statement. This allows you to modify specific columns of one or more rows based on a condition specified in the `WHERE` clause.

---

### **Update Statement with Values:**

```sql
UPDATE mytable
SET column = value_or_expr,
    other_column = another_value_or_expr,
    ‚Ä¶
WHERE condition;
```

- **`SET` clause**: Defines the column(s) to update and their new values (or expressions).
- **`WHERE` clause**: Ensures only rows meeting the specified condition are updated. It's crucial to avoid updating all rows by forgetting this clause.

### **Be Careful!**

Always verify your condition first by running a `SELECT` query with the same `WHERE` clause. This ensures you're updating the right rows.

## üìö **Conclusion**

The `UPDATE` statement is powerful for modifying existing data in a database. Always test the conditions in a `SELECT` query before running the `UPDATE` to prevent unintended changes. By using `WHERE` conditions, you ensure that only the desired rows are updated.
