# üìä **SQL Review: Simple SELECT Queries**

Congratulations on making it this far! In this review, you‚Äôll practice writing **SELECT queries** that solve real-world problems using a table of data. This will help you get comfortable with combining different SQL clauses to retrieve specific information.

---

## üîé **SELECT Query Syntax**

The general format of a **SELECT** query is:

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

By combining these clauses, you can retrieve, filter, sort, and limit the data that you need.

## üìù **Review 1 ‚Äî Tasks**

Use the **north_american_cities** table to complete the following tasks:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **List all the Canadian cities and their populations**

To retrieve all Canadian cities and their populations, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT city, population
FROM north_american_cities
WHERE country = 'Canada';
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Order all the cities in the United States by their latitude from north to south**

To order cities in the U.S. based on latitude from north to south, use this query:

```sql
SELECT city, latitude
FROM north_american_cities
WHERE country = 'United States'
ORDER BY latitude DESC;
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **List all the cities west of Chicago, ordered from west to east**

To find cities west of Chicago (i.e., cities with a longitude less than Chicago's longitude) and order them from west to east:

```sql
SELECT city, longitude
FROM north_american_cities
WHERE longitude < -87.629798
ORDER BY longitude ASC;
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **List the two largest cities in Mexico (by population)**

To find the two largest cities in Mexico by population:

```sql
SELECT city, population
FROM north_american_cities
WHERE country = 'Mexico'
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **List the third and fourth largest cities (by population) in the United States and their population**

To retrieve the third and fourth largest U.S. cities by population:

```sql
SELECT city, population
FROM north_american_cities
WHERE country = 'United States'
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
```
