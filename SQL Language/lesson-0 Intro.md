### 🚗 Example: DMV Database

Let’s say the **Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)** has a database of vehicles. It might look like this:

| **Id** | **Make/Model**    | **# Wheels** | **# Doors** | **Type**   |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1      | Ford Focus        | 4            | 4           | Sedan      |
| 2      | Tesla Roadster    | 4            | 2           | Sports     |
| 3      | Kawasaki Ninja    | 2            | 0           | Motorcycle |
